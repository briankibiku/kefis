          1.10p.m, 2 – 2.10p.m, 6 – 6.10p.m and 7 – 7.10p.m
        </li>

        <li>Each mSwali session has ten questions</li>
        <li>Each of the ten questions is timed at 10 seconds</li>
        <li>
          To WIN the trivia a user has to answer ALL questions correctly
        </li>
        <li>
          Each question answered correctly earns a user 10points on the
          leaderboard
        </li>
        <li>
          The leaderboard displays the top 10 players with their earned points
          earned
        </li>
        <li>To access all the SIX sessions in a day a user has to pay 50/=</li>
        <li>
          If a first-time user deposits 20/= they get a free session to play, if
          they deposit amounts greater than 20/= but not less than 50/= they get
          the whole day for free
        </li>
        <li>
          The daily rate of 50/= is not applicable after the 2 – 2.10p.m session
          but applicable between 7.10p.m to 2.10p.m of the following day.
        </li>
        <li>
          A user can select if they want to pay per session or for the whole
          day. This is activated once the user has accessed a session.
        </li>
        <li>
          During a game session a user is notified if they got a question wrong
          and they can proceed without winning the trivia. They only earn points
          for each question answered correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          The prize money for each session is 5,000/= and is shared amongst all

          and conditions
        </li>
        <li>

          questions to get a feel of the game
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>mSwali users can check their standings on the leaderboard</li>
        <li>
          mSwali users can refer their friends to play mSwali and get rewarded
          with 1 credit worth 20/= for a free mSwali session. The deposit made
          by the referred user determines what the referee gets e.g. if a
          referral deposits 20/= the referee gets a free session or if a
          referral deposits 50/= the referee gets a whole day.
        </li>
        <li>
          mSwali users have an option to choose if they want to pay for a
          session or a whole day, and this money is deducted from the user’s
          wallet
        </li>
        <li>
          When a user’s session times out, the user can pick up where they left
